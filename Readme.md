this app contain 
package.json file in root directory
server folder containing backend (store front api)
frontend folder contain index.html file to connect to api

to start the app
follow below url

http://full-stack-ali-2.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/

Then in the opened web page you can register user and list all users in data base

In this project we used the following AWS technologies to host the app

1- Elastic bean stalk
   we used elastic bean stalk to host backend environment 
2- S3 bucket:
   we used S3 bucket to host our frontend static files 
3- RDS:
   we used RDS to provide database to our app

then we used circleci and connect it to the project github repositori so any new version updated to the reposatory will automatically be reflected to the version deployed in the AWS 

Thanks a lot
